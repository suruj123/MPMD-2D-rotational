1. The code is written in C and parallelized using MPI. 
2. This is a 2D code and simulates the annular region between two rotating circles.
3. This code is capable of handling various non-eqiulibrium statistical mechanics problems.
4. At present, I have demonstrated rotational KH instability using this 2D rotational MPMD code.
5. The "initial profile generator" folder  is used to generate the initial profile. In this forlder, the "perturbation_adder.c" code genrtaes the intial profile. The "grid-2D-parallel2_rot.c" code used to check whether the perturbation is added properly or not.
5. The initla profile is names as "STATE". 
6. For compilation, one need to go to the "source" forlder and load "intel-2018".
7. With the help of the "make" command, the code is compiled.
8. An executable calle  "main" is ganerated and using "job.sh" the run is submitted in our Antya Cluster.
9. The "Vorticity_contour.pdf" file shows the KH instability.
